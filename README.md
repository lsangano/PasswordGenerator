The purpose of this homework assignment was to create random password generator. This assignment already included a creaded html and css but no js. We were required to create javascript from scratch. The criteria that needed to be satisfied included the page having a functioning password generating button, various prompts that asked questions regarding length of password as well as character types to be used(where certain character types would be added or deducted in the final password based on user response) and finally having the randomly generated button displayed on the screen. All criteria were met and the generator functions exactly to the given specifications. The page makes sure to check that the length criteria are met, atl east one character type is chosen and finally displays the generated password on screen. The main javascript processes used included if/else statement, global/local variables, arrays/array methods and finally various window prompt.
